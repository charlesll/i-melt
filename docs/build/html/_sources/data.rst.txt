Database
========

Database localisation
---------------------

All data are given in a Database_IPGP.xlsx file in the data folder. Raman spectra are contained in a ./data/raman/ folder.

Data preparation
----------------

The notebook **Dataset_preparation.ipynb** allows preparation of the datasets, which are subsequently saved in HDF5 format in the data folder.

The **Dataset_visualization.ipynb** notebook shows the distribution of data in ternary plots.
