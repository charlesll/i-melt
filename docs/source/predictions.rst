Predictions

The easiest way to try i-Melt is to use the `web calculator <https://i-melt.streamlit.app/>`_.

Jupyter notebooks
-----------------

More control can be achieved using directly the i-melt Python library. Have a look at the :doc:`tutorials` page.


The steps are simple. First, import the necessary libraries and imelt:

.. code-block:: python

  %matplotlib inline #matplotlib magic


  import numpy as np # for arrays
  import pandas as pd # for dataframes
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # for plotting
  import imelt

Then, we can load the pre-trained i-melt models as one Python object:

.. code-block:: python

  imelt_model = imelt.load_pretrained_bagged()

Now we can define a composition of interest using the `generate_query_single` function:
It does everything automatically for us, including the addition of descriptors.

.. code-block:: python

  composition = imelt.generate_query_single(sio2 = 75.0, 
                                          al2o3 = 12.5,
                                          na2o = 12.5, 
                                          k2o = 0.0,
                                          mgo = 0.0,
                                          cao = 0.0, 
                                   composition_mole=True)

To get predictions from the model `imelt_model`, we use its `predict` method:

  .. code-block:: python

      prediction = imelt_model.predict("property", composition)

where "property" is a string indicating the property you want, composition is a compositional array that has been put in good shape (simply use the `generate_query_single` or `generate_query_range` to do so). Optional arguments are the temperature T and lbd, the optical wavelength at which you want the optical refractive index if that is what you are after.

Here is a list of the "property" available:

  - melt viscosity (log10 Pa s) using Adam-Gibbs: enter "ag"
  - melt viscosity (log10 Pa s) using Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher: enter "tvf"
  - melt viscosity (log10 Pa s) using Free Volume: enter "cg"
  - melt viscosity (log10 Pa s) using Avramov-Milchev: enter "am"
  - melt viscosity (log10 Pa s) using MYEGA: enter "myega"
  - melt fragility : enter "fragility"
  - melt liquidus (K) : enter "liquidus"
  - glass transition temperature (K): enter "tg"
  - glass configurational entropy (J/mol/K) : enter "sctg"
  - glass density (in K): enter "density_glass"
  - glass elastic modulus (GPa) : enter "elastic_modulus"
  - glass coefficient of thermal expansion : enter "cte"
  - glass Abbe number : enter "abbe"
  - glass optical refractive index : enter "sellmeier"
  - glass Raman spectrum : enter "raman_pred"

  Note that for the melt viscosity you must provide a vector of temperature, and for the glass optical refractive you must provide a vector of wavelength.

For instance, if you want predictions for melt viscosity between 1000 and 3000 K with a step of 1 K, you will do

.. code-block:: python

    T_range = np.arange(1000.0, 3000.0, 1.0)
    viscosity = imelt_model.predict("vft", composition, T_range)

To get the glass optical refractive index at 589 nm, you will do:

WARNING : lambda is provided in microns !

.. code-block:: python
  
    lbd = np.array([589.0*1e-3]) # warning: enter wavenumber in microns
    ri = imelt_model.predict("sellmeier", composition, lbd=lbd) 

And for a property such as Tg, you can do:

.. code-block:: python

  tg = imelt_model.predict("tg", composition)

If you want error bars, you need to ask for samples:

.. code-block:: python

  tg = imelt_model.predict("tg", composition, sampling=True, n_sample=20)
  
Here tg contains 20 samples from the 10 different models, so a total of 200 predictions. You can now calculate the standard deviation and mean values of tg as:

.. code-block:: python

  tg_standard_deviation = np.std(tg)
  tg_mean = np.mean(tg)

Another way, better, may be to ask for the 95% confidence intervals and the median:

.. code-block:: python

  tg_95CI = np.percentile(tg, [2.5, 97.5])
  tg_median = np.median(tg)

We can predict the viscosity with the Vogel-Tammann-Fulscher equation. First, we create a array containing the temperatures of interest, then we calculate the viscosity:

.. code-block:: python

  T_range = np.arange(600, 1500, 1.0) # from 600 to 1500 K with 1 K steps
  viscosity = imelt_model.predict("tvf", composition, T_range)

In the above code note that the composition array has to be modified so that you have as many lines as you have temperatures to predict.

Many other predictions are possible, look at the :doc:`tutorials` for more details and examples.
