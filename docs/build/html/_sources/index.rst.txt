The i-Melt project
------------------

i-Melt is a physics-guided neural network model, that combines deep neural networks with physical equations to predict the structural, thermodynamic and dynamic properties of aluminosilicate melts and glasses.

The project is hosted on Github (`here! <https://github.com/charlesll/imelt>`_)
