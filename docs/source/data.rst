Database
========

Database localisation
---------------------

All data are given in a `Database.xlsx <https://github.com/charlesll/i-melt/blob/master/data/Database.xlsx>`_ file in the `/src/imelt/data folder <https://github.com/charlesll/i-melt/tree/master/data>`_.

The data used for training the currently provided models are in HDF5 format in the data folder. They are also provided with the library in /src/imelt/data/.

Data preparation
----------------

The script `Dataset_preparation.py <https://github.com/charlesll/i-melt/blob/master/src/Dataset_preparation.py>`_ allows preparing the datasets, which are subsequently saved in HDF5 format in the data folder.

The `Dataset_visualization.py <https://github.com/charlesll/i-melt/blob/master/src/Dataset_visualization.py>`_ script allows running the generation of several figures, saved in /figures/datasets/

Processed Raman spectra are also shown in /figures/datasets/raman/
